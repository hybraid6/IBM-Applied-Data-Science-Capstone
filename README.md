# Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing
This repository captures the culmination of the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project focused on predicting the success of the Falcon 9 first-stage landing. The project seamlessly integrates data collection, extensive exploratory data analysis interactive visualization, and machine learning for insightful predictions.

### Project Highlights:

**Data Collection & Wrangling:**

Utilized a RESTful API and web scraping (BeautifulSoup) to collect data on Falcon 9 first-stage landings.
Transformed the data into a structured dataframe, performing essential data wrangling for analysis with Pandas and SQL.

**Interactive Dashboards:**

Built interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash to analyze launch records, providing a dynamic visual representation of launch outcomes.
Implemented an interactive map with Folium to analyze launch site proximity, enhancing geographical insights.

**Machine Learning for Predictions:**

Employed machine learning techniques to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing.
Split the data into training and test sets, optimizing hyperparameters for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression.
Evaluated and selected the best-performing model based on test data.

**Comprehensive Data-Driven Insights:**

Compiled all activities into a cohesive presentation, delivering data-driven insights on the likelihood of the Falcon 9 first stage landing successfully.
Provided actionable information for cost predictions, valuable for companies bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.
